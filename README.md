#### <ins>Instructions:</ins> <br />

1. Type your bet amount (must be less than the "bones" value)
2. Press Enter, or click the 'SPIN' button
3. Press Space, or click the 'STOP' button to stop the spin and find out if you won that round or not,
4. repeat until you run out of bones, good luck!
5. If you run out of bones, click the 'RESTART' button to start over with 10 bones.

### <ins>**Next Steps:**</ins>

- I would like to clean up the spin animation, and make each reel stop independently of the others so you can try to time the slot and win more.
- Some sound effects may be a cool touch
- A more complex points system would be beneficial to the playability of this game.
